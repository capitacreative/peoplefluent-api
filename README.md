Integration
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Being a web developer you need to integrate the library with your project by yourself. 
Capita Creative maintains *only* the latest version of the library.
We can help you in integration but we are not performing an integration of this library on any projects.
You can adjust the library specifically to the project requirements.
